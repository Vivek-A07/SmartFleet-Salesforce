Factories and warehouses often rely on industrial vehicles such as forklifts, AGVs (Automated Guided Vehicles), and delivery trucks. Currently, service logs, fuel usage, and breakdown incidents are tracked manually. This leads to unexpected breakdowns, high maintenance costs, and difficulty in monitoring fleet performance across multiple sites.
